=======================
Third party libraries
=======================

GenLib uses the JFreeChart-Library and JCommons. They are both under GNU LGPL
license. The versions I currently use GenLib with are as *.jar in the lib
directory. More informations: http://www.jfree.org/




===========
First steps
===========

There is an example-viewer included, so just start the GenLib.jar. I would
recommend it to start in the console, so you don't miss the text-output.
For examples, using the GenLib-functionality, see: src/genlib/examples/

The library is currently under heavy development, so currently, there is no
good documentation available. Please have a look at the javadoc annotations.

Editing is restricted for collaborators only, so if you are interested in
collaborating, please contact me via git-hub:
